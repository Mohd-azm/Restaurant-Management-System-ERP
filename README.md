Restaurant Management System – This is another open-source project that we have worked on. This project is based on Codeigniter, MySQL, adminlte, bootstrap, and jquery. The administrator can manage more than one store in this system. They can track each user, product, order, and table based on the stores. The super administrator can view everything based on every store. The user’s privileges can be done by the super administrator. The administrator is responsible for user permission. He will need to set the user permission to create, update, view, and delete each module on this system.





We have listed down the system features in the below section. We will also teach you how to install this system successfully.
